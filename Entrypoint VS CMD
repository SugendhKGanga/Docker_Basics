Docker has a default entrypoint which is /bin/sh -c but does not have a default command.

When you run docker like this: 
docker run -i -t ubuntu bash 
the entrypoint is the default /bin/sh -c, the image is ubuntu and the command is bash.

The command is run via the entrypoint. i.e., the actual thing that gets executed is /bin/sh -c bash.
This allowed docker to implement RUN quickly by relying on the shell's parser. 
Later on, people asked to be able to customize this so ENTRYPOINT and -entrypoint has been introduced.

<cmd> will be the parameter of the entrypoint.
